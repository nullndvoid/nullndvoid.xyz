Please be aware that git.nullndvoid.xyz is down at the moment 
as [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) is quite memory hungry.

## Some projects I am working on

* sewerat
  + Language: Zig
  + Description: A simple (WIP) remote access tool
  + Repo: [git.nullndvoid.xyz](https://git.nullndvoid.xyz/sewerat/sewerat-zig)

* matrix client-server sdk for Zig
  + Language: Zig
  + Description: A Client-Server http client for Zig.
  + Repo: [github.com/nullndvoid](https://github.com/nullndvoid/zig-matrix-clientserver-sdk)
  + I am writing this so I can eventually write a matrix client.
