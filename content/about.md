## About Me

I am a high-school student interested in systems programming and open source software, I enjoy working with programming languages such as Zig, which I am currently trying to work on projects in.

As for other computing skills, take a look [here](#what-skillsinterests-do-you-have).

### What is your name?

Jacob Hinchliffe.

### Where are you from?

The UK.

### What skills/interests do you have?

#### Computing

I have used Linux on my PC for about 2 years full-time (longer if you count dual-booting, VMs) and I have experience with these distros:

* Artix Linux
* Arch Linux
* Gentoo Linux (currently running)
* Debian 11 (on a VPS)
* Void Linux

I have learned a lot of useful skills, such as:

* Writing scripts to manage and rice my system
* Setting up an email server (not from scratch yet)
* Setting up a webserver (caddy and nginx in the past)
* Hosting a Matrix homeserver (up right now at `nullndvoid.xyz`)

#### Otherwise

Not much, I listen to a lot of Spotify though and I am watching Better Call Saul at the moment, it's great.

## About this site

### Where's the darn code?

The site's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/nullndvoid/nullndvoid.xyz).

I made the theme myself, I don't need much at the moment so it is incredibly simple, as a base however I used [this](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-theme) by Eric Murphy. It provides an excellent and simple base for Hugo themes, which brings me onto the next question.

### What is the site built with?

I'm currently using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator, and I have used Zola in the past. 

### The colours look funny

If you have any extensions to give sites a dark theme, please try toggling this site off.

### The colours still look funny

Try using lynx.
